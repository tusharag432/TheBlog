Thanks to the rise of low-cost airlines and a burgeoning middle class, Indian airlines carry 10 million more passengers a year today than they did just a decade ago.\r\n\r\nBut for the all the benefits of accessible air travel, one problem that simply refuses to go away is the unreliability of service. Put simply, flight delays and cancellations are rife.\r\n\r\nThe statistics are quite damning. Spice Jet, the country\'s second largest airline in terms of passenger numbers, recorded average delays of just under 40 minutes over the summer according to flightstats.com, while just under 40% of its flights were either cancelled or diverted. Air India, meanwhile, the country\'s state-owned flag carrier, recorded average delays of around 25 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn fact, despite the fact that demand for air travel is increasing day by day across the country, just one Indian airline, IndiGo, runs at a profit.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations are protected by the law and are entitled to up to €600 compensation for disruptions for which the airlines are responsible. No such legislation exists in India, which is just as well for the airlines. A quick read through the news reveals case after case of delays and cancellations caused by airline mismanagement. If Indian airlines were to continue operating as they do now within a framework which forces them to compensate passengers for disruptions, it is likely that a good few would not last long.\r\n\r\nHow to fix the issue is a matter of debate. To a certain extent, flight delays and cancellations are not unique to India. Look to any country in the world with a busy aviation network - the United States, Europe, wherever - and you\'ll encounter delays. But for many, India\'s chronic problems go to the very top, to the Government and to the mismanagement of the state\'s flag carrier, Air India. Corrupt officials are widespread, it is said, while contracts are handed out to political and business allies as a matter of course. The solution, say many commentators, is privatisation.\r\n\r\nThe privatisation of previously state-owned airlines has worked well in countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany, where ownership and management of flag carriers British Airways and Lufthansa were transferred to private hands in 1987 and 1994 respectively. Such a move could potentially remove control from corrupt and incompetent members of the public administration. With the airline operating as a private business without government protection and insulation from traditional market forces, many believe that incentives to improve service would rise and that the airline would be better managed as a result.\r\n\r\nWhatever the solution may be, it is clear that India needs to find it soon. International business is growing, and the country is emerging on the world stage. With traffic in and out of the subcontinent set to continue growing, its aviation network needs to be improved drastically before it can be relied upon.', 'alexey-starki-91ykdj2WQeg-unsplash.jpg', 'S Smith', 'Politics', '2021-06-27 20:05:10'),
(63, 'Is WWIII Coming?', 'Instability in Eastern Europe already has precedent for starting the largest wars mankind has ever seen. Nuclear deterrence has worked since World War Two but seems to no longer be the force for p...', 'Shocking news out of Kiev came out this weekend about the conflict in Eastern Europe. According to Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heltey, Russia is prepared to drop nuclear bombs on Ukraine. \"The Russian side has threatened on several occasions across unofficial channels that, in the case of continued resistance they are ready to use a tactical nuclear weapon against us,\" Heltey posted on his facebook page. What this means for the already tense situation in Europe is anyone\'s guess.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no secret that the Global political and financial climates are extremely uncertain. During the period of Ukranian Civil Unrest, European and American Media all but dismissed President Putin\'s insistence that the West was funding the dissenters and trying to engage Russia in a war by proxy. Whether or not that is true is still up for plenty of debate, but what seems to be all but certain is eventually the United States and NATO will come into direct conflict with Putin in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nPutin has already warned the European Commission that, \"If I wanted to, I can take Kiev in two weeks.\" I don\'t think anyone in the West doubts that he means exactly what he says. The first term of Obama\'s presidency proved that Putin will follow through with his plans when left to his own devices.\r\n\r\nEconomic sanctions imposed by the West are the only form of diplomacy left, but in themselves are acts of aggression and may force Putin to become even more hostile. He\'s not letting go of Crimea, that conflict is over with, and financial restrictions may force him to sweep Eastern Ukraine - the rise of nationalism for winning a popular war would help quell the pains that economic sanctions will surely bring. How far will Western Europe push Ukraine when they\'re so reliant on Russian Natural Gas? Would Eastern Ukraine really be worth a freezing winter with no gas to heat the homes of the rich and poor alike? What about Western Ukraine?\r\n\r\nThe only thing we can be sure about Putin is to expect the unexpected. It\'s becoming clear that his goal is to restore the might of the Soviet Union, at least in terms of land. He\'s always hated having NATO on his doorstep, so there\'s no telling how far West he will push until he feels secure. NATO and Russia are obviously the two largest Nuclear powers in World History. Putin has alarmingly not dismissed the possibility of short to mid-range Nuclear weapons, and it\'s not hard to envision a scenario where he feels forced to use them, especially if he feels Russian sovereignty is threatened. Will the final straw become having Ukraine join NATO? He seems to have made it clear that he feels Western armies in Ukraine would all but be an act of war.\r\n\r\nInstability in Eastern Europe already has precedent for starting the largest wars mankind has ever seen. Nuclear deterrence has worked since World War Two but seems to no longer be the force for peace that it once was. Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, there hasn\'t been a period of time that has been so close to an armed global conflict.\r\n\r\nPresident Putin has appeared emboldened by the reluctance of United States President Barack Obama to challenge him head-on. There\'s no telling what will come in the second half of 2014, but predicting further aggression from Russia seems to be a safe bet.\r\n\r\nObviously war in Europe would be a disaster for the Euro, the Dollar, as well as currencies around the globe. Investing in precious metals and gold bullion is going to become more common in the ensuing crisis. The Dow Jones market, which has certainly rebounded, is most likely inflated artificially. Global, or even a large regional conflict, would burst the bubble of our so-called economic recovery, and plunge the market back into recession. Many people with the means have been finding that a self-directed gold IRA is the best choice for their investment needs in these uncertain times. Being diversified and investing in solid assets -such as gold or silver- is a smart play in the upcoming months.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.a1articles.com/is-wwiii-coming-2439665.html', 'mike-andersen-0r5Hn8IG5cQ-unsplash.jpg', 'Senno MBP', 'Politics', '2021-06-27 20:07:55'),

Debbink, Navy Reserve chief, said reserve sailors provide full- and part-time operational capabilities and strategic depth for maritime missions, ensuring rapid global response t...', 'The military’s reserve components remain ready and capable despite budget cuts and their transition from a strategic to operational force, senior National Guard and Reserve officials told the Senate Appropriations Committee’s defense subcommittee here yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs the drawdown continues in Afghanistan, the Guard and Reserve will maintain deployment-ready units undeterred by force structure changes such as the Air National Guard’s end strength reduction by 5,100 billets and aircraft inventory reduction by 134 aircraft, Air Force Gen. Craig R. McKinley, National Guard Bureau chief, told the senators.\r\n\r\nFor example, McKinley said, the Air National Guard’s partnership with more than 60 foreign countries has strengthened the component’s military capacity and competence.\r\n\r\nAir Force Lt. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, Air National Guard director, said 22 partner nations have provided 11,000 troops to Afghanistan, and 40 partner nations have provided more than 31,000 personnel in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. Last year, Guard airmen filled about 54,000 requests for manpower, he added, noting that 91 percent of those requests were fulfilled with volunteers.\r\n\r\nWyatt said the Air National Guard’s budget request priorities were to align force size and composition to be flexible, agile and ready with a focus on new missions, such as the MC-12 intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft. He added that other high priorities included maintaining a combat-ready force able to quickly surge and integrate seamlessly in joint operations while rearranging units impacted by the base closure and realignment process and recent programming changes.\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. William E. Ingram Jr., Army National Guard director, said the Army National Guard provides cost-effective solutions to meet budget requirements. For 12.3 percent of the Army\'s base budget, he said, the Army National Guard provides 39 percent of the Army\'s operating forces. In 2011, he told the panel, citizen-soldiers provided 900,000 duty days of support to communities across the nation.\r\n\r\n“We are attracting skilled soldiers and future leaders,” he said. “With the nation at war as a backdrop, our year-to-date enlistment rate for [fiscal 2012] is in excess of 95 percent, but our retention rate exceeds 130 percent. So we are meeting our authorized end strength of 358,000.”\r\n\r\nVice Adm. Dirk J. Debbink, Navy Reserve chief, said reserve sailors provide full- and part-time operational capabilities and strategic depth for maritime missions, ensuring rapid global response to crisis situations while maintaining fiscal efficiency across the spectrum of operations.\r\n\r\n“The Reserve C-40A Program is enabling our critical intratheater lift capability today to be more cost-effective and flexible, and thus more operationally relevant well into the future,” he said. “Our 2012 budget request will enable the Navy Reserve to continue supporting current operations while maximizing the strategic value of the Navy Reserve, a force valued for its readiness, innovation, agility and accessibility.”\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. Steven A. Hummer, commander of Marine Forces Reserve, said that as the active-component Marine Corps reshapes from 201,000 Marines to a force of about 182,100, the Marine Corps Reserve will leverage its diverse depth and range to mitigate risk and maximize opportunities.\r\n\r\n“I am highly confident that the authorized Marine Corps [Reserve] end strength of 39,600 is appropriate for providing us with the personnel required to support the total force during active component build-down,” he said.\r\nThe Air Force Reserve, however, may face personnel challenges, with a projected reduction of 900 personnel that Lt. Gen. Charles E. Stenner Jr., Air Force Reserve chief, described as the “tip of the iceberg.”\r\n\r\n“Our Reserve is losing trained personnel and taking on new missions,” he said. “The personnel losses are in specialties that are still essential to the total force and at the same time don\'t easily transfer to newly assigned mission areas.”\r\n\r\nStenner noted that an aircraft maintainer with 17 years of experience cannot become a cyber warrior with 17 years of experience overnight. “With that perspective, the Air Force is actually losing the capability of 5,000 to 6,000 experienced and trained personnel, and that loss could seriously affect the strategic reserve posture,” he told the senators.\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. Jack C. Stultz, Army Reserve chief, said the quality of his citizen-soldiers gives him confidence for the force’s future. He told the panel about Sgt. Daniel Burgess, who lost his leg and suffered severe wounds to the rest of his body from a roadside bomb explosion while attached to a Marine Corps unit in southern Afghanistan. Burgess insisted on remaining in the military and is rehabilitating at the Warrior Training Brigade at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n“That epitomizes why we\'re here; we\'re here because of them,” Stultz said. “We\'ve got to make sure we\'re doing everything within our power in an era where we are looking to save money and reduce debt, but we cannot afford to shortchange these great soldiers, because they are protecting our nation, and they\'re our first line of defense.”\r\nMcKinley told the senators the reserve components have evolved from being a strategic reserve to an operational force over the last decade of war, and that should be the way of the future.\r\n\r\n“During a time of constrained budgets, we should continue to be used as an operational force to ensure the nation is getting the most defense capability at the lowest cost,” McKinley said, adding that more than 50 percent of Guardsmen have combat experience.\r\n\r\nGetting Bail Bonds for a friend or family member has never been easier.

Structure is the research of how living creatures perform the various functions of life. Human anatomy, which, with structure and chemistry is a supporting basic medical science, is mainly the study of the morphology of the adult human body. It is the study of relationship between human system components and features. Body components and features are closely related, why? Because our human body is unique, the components are engineered to adapt and support our human body features and systems.\r\n\r\nMain Idea:\r\nHierarchy:\r\n1. Chemical level: simplest stage of architectural hierarchy.Ex: atoms--molecules--organelles.\r\n2. Cellular level: primary architectural and efficient units of lifestyle.\r\n3. Cells level: groups of similar cells with a common function. Ex: epithelium, ligament, muscle, nervous cells.\r\n4. Human body organ level: A human body organ is a structure consisting of at least two cells types that functions a specific operate for one\'s human body.\r\n5. Human body organ system level: organs that work with one another to accomplish a primary operate and purpose.\r\n6. Patient level: human body organ techniques working together to accomplish functions required for lifestyle.\r\n\r\nLevels of organization of the human body:\r\nChemical - created up of atoms and molecules.\r\nCell - are basic architectural and efficient units of an patient. There are many different kinds of cells in one\'s human body including: sensors cells, blood vessels cells, muscles and fat cells.\r\nCells - groups of cells & the surrounding environment that perform together to produce a particular function. There are only four kinds of cells in the body: epithelial tissue, ligament, muscular cells and anxious tissue.\r\nBody organ – organs are components that are created of two or more different kinds of cells, they have particular functions & a defined shape. The heart is an example of an organ; it is created of muscular, connective, & anxious tissue. The cells perform in concert to move blood vessels through one\'s human body.\r\n\r\nTissue in the human body:\r\n\r\nEpithelial: Is created of cells organized in a ongoing sheet with one or more levels, has apical & basal areas. An underground room membrane part is the connection between the basal area of the mobile & the actual ligament.\r\nThere are two kinds of epithelial tissues: (1) Covering & coating epithelia and (2) Glandular Epithelium.\r\n\r\n• Simple Epithelium - one mobile layer\r\n• Stratified epithelium - two or more mobile layers\r\n\r\nConnective: contains many different mobile kinds including: fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, and adipocytes. Connective Cells Matrix is created of two materials: ground substance - necessary protein and polysaccharides, fiber – reticular, bovine collagen and flexible.\r\n\r\nCategory of Connective Tissue:\r\n\r\n• Loose Connective - materials & many mobile kinds in gelatinous matrix, discovered in skin, & surrounding veins, nerve fibres, and organs.\r\n• Heavy Connective - Many of similar bovine collagen fibers& fibroblasts, discovered in tendons& structures.\r\n\r\nMuscle: Muscle is separated into 3 groups, skeletal, heart and sleek.\r\n\r\n1)Skeletal Muscular – non-reflex, striated, striations verticle with respect to the muscles and it is mainly discovered attached to bone fragments.\r\n2)Cardiac Muscular – unconscious, striated, extended and has intercalated discs\r\n3)Smooth Muscular – unconscious, nonstriated, spindle formed and is discovered in veins & the GI tract.\r\n\r\nNervous: Includes only two mobile kinds in the neurological program (CNS) & side-line neurological program (PNS). Nerves - Cells that turn stimulating elements into electrical desires to the brain, and Neuroglia – helpful cells are created up of mobile human body, axon and dendrites. There are 3 kinds of neurons:\r\n\r\n•Engine Neuron – carry desires from CNS to muscles and glands.\r\n• Interneuron - understand feedback from neurological neurons and end reactions to motor neurons.\r\n• Sensory Neuron – receive information from environment and transfer to CNS.\r\n\r\nDevelopment: All cells of one\'s human body develop from the three primary bacteria mobile levels that kind the embryo\r\n\r\n• Mesoderm – produces into epithelial tissue, ligament and muscular cells.\r\n• Ectoderm - produces into anxious tissue and epithelial tissue.\r\n• Endoderm – produces into epithelial tissue.\r\n\r\nCell Junctions: There are 5 types of cell or tisssue junctions in the human body. They are\r\n\r\n• Tight Junctions - Form a closure between cells; determine apical and basal sides of an epithelial cell\r\n• Gap Junctions - An open 4 way stop between two cells, which allows ions, & little elements to pass easily between the cells.\r\n• Adherens Junctions - Weblink actin cytoskeletal elements in two cells.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nThe purpose that individuals will want to understand about the requirements of individual system and structure is it will educate them about what is going on in their individual body. Being injured and having to go see a doctor can be a terrifying here we are at individuals. However, if the person has a working knowledge on some of the parts of one\'s human body, it will be easy for them to see just how important this is. That is when they should know about the value of learning about one\'s human body. Without knowing on the value of components of human anatomy and physiology it will be nearly impossible for some individuals to understand what exactly is going on with their human body at some point.\r\n\r\nOMICS Publishing Group covers scientific articles in about 200 open access journals with special emphasis on Life sciences, Pharmaceutical, Medical, and Environmental related topics , under an Open Access Policy that allows sharing of knowledge.\r\n\r\nopen access journals.\r\nopen access.\r\nanatomy & physiology.', 'nhia-moua-F4cJtI7HCMw-unsplash.jpg', 'Rekh', 'Science and Technology', '2021-06-27 20:28:36'),

As a result, the solar panel craze is gathering up pace with more homeowners seeking to invest in the technology and reap the well documented benefits of such eco-friendly technology.\r\n\r\nOne factor that may have enhanced the recent surge in solar panel technology is the announcement of government schemes, such as feed in tariffs and the renewable heat incentive, both of which have been designed to enhance the rewards that come with implementing renewable energy solutions, as well as improving the energy efficiency rating of our households and the eco-friendliness of our environment.\r\n\r\nThe DECC announced that to date 11,314 brits have looked favourably upon both the scheme and the technology, and opted to install Solar Panels.\r\n\r\nUnder the Feed In tariff scheme, homeowners can earn extra money by exporting their unused electricity back to the grid, so that the customer saves money, and the electrical provider reduces waste. The scheme can save you hundreds of pounds on top of the savings you would be making anyway through the use of solar panels.\r\n\r\nAnother contributing factor to the success is the increase in consumer awareness, with more efforts being put in place to make all consumers aware of sustainable building solutions available to them, like the new Jewson TV advert bring shown this month on SKY, which shows the new Saint-Gobain solar PV panels and other renewable technologies. On top of that there’s an increase in the awareness of government schemes and money saving alternative technologies.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the push for increased environmental awareness comes down to the government’s target to reduce UK CO2 emissions by 34 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020. The government believe they are well on their way to achieving this target, with a 21% reduction already achieved by the UK, which is equal to a stopping all emissions from four cities the size of London.\r\n\r\nThe support and adoption of these government schemes will only enhance these efforts, with more plans for sustainable grants surely in the pipeline for the future. The success of the feed in tariff has meant that the government are also introducing a new renewable heat incentive, which is aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuel heating systems and instead investing in renewable heating technology.\r\n\r\nOne company that has benefitted from the increase in demand of sustainable building products is Jewson. Their Market Director of sustainability, Malcolm Gough stated “we have definitely noticed a growing trend and popularity towards solar panels, with many consumers looking to embrace the technology. This has had a great affect on the business, and the introduction of our Saint-Gobain PV panels and the opening of Greenworks training academy, who provide MCS training to our customers. This adds to Jewsons market leading strength as being the one stop shop for renewable energy sources.”\r\n\r\nGreenworks provide sustainable building solutions to all, including Solar Panels, rainwater harvesters and ground source heat pumps.', 'american-public-power-association-513dBrMJ_5w-unsplash.jpg', 'Anthony', 'Science and Technology', '2021-06-27 20:41:20'),

Children diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorders may still pursue their education during a non-threateni...', 'An education is one amongst the most very important things a person will possess if they want to achieve a successful career in this world. Children are attending traditional schools for years and years; however virtual highschool is that the way forward for education. It\'s becoming clearer, as time goes on, that every student learns at a different pace which weaknesses and strengths vary greatly. It is not hard to imagine that some students would possibly merely learn better with the use of technology. With the advances of tablets, phones and computers, a lot of children are exposed to technology earlier. it is not uncommon to see children playing on their parents\' phones or view cartoons on tablets. This exposure might incline these children to learn better through the means of technology.\r\n\r\nComputer advances are being integrated into education all over. Standardized testing on the upper level (MCAT & GRE) is now taken on computers rather than scantrons or paper. The invention and growth of blackboard provides a method for lecturers and students to communicate digitally concerning homework assignments or to raise queries in both the highschool and college setting. Thanks to these great advances in technology and website design, virtual high school has become a viable and extremely logical choice for a few students. There are several children in certain social circumstances that would greatly benefit from attending high school online. These programs can provide students who might not otherwise see graduation the opportunity to complete their schooling.\r\n\r\nAn army brat that moves around the country constantly, for instance, ought not to frequently begin at new locations and miss out on material during this method. The learning method would never be interrupted if it were being conducted digitally. Children diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorders may still pursue their education during a non-threatening environment.\r\n\r\nThough students will not be attending in person, they should not feel a lack of community. Courses are still taught by certified teachers and students interact with other students. However, the content is more customized, paced specifically for the child and still collaborative. Virtual highschool also permits precocious students to pursue a additional accelerated path of education for early graduation. each subject traditionally taught at physical locations is reflected within the online program, starting from social studies to language and math.\r\n\r\nThe Pinnacle Online High School is tuition free, accredited, Arizona public charter school, serving students in grades 6-12. Our school provides the highest quality educational experience, outstanding curriculum, and highly qualified teachers to students and families seeking a more flexible experience than in the traditional school.', 'thomas-park-SS-r7BvCqTY-unsplash.jpg', 'Anthony', 'Science and Technology', '2021-06-27 20:44:12'),

It is used because of its artistic quality in...', 'Canvas prints are the byproduct of photographic or graphic images printed on canvas that are stretched or gallery-wrapped, onto a frame. They are also known by their other terms such as canvas art or stretched canvas. Since 1990s, the images have been reproduced and printed on canvas fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe printing is associated with dye sublimation and the use of inkjet print process that use inkjet-based printers that can print directly onto canvas. Another term for the inkjet process s is Giclee printing. Two of the brands of printers that are capable of printing directly onto a canvas fabric are the HP Designjet and the Epson Stylus Pro.\r\n\r\nThe modern concept of canvas print is given a lift by the technological development of graphics technology such as the printers and the software. The advent of technology paved the way for artists to make their arts available to everyone, and their skills in the service of anybody.\r\n\r\nBoth on the web and on the brick and mortar world, artists and photographers set up their galleries, studios and print houses to create products to satisfy the customer’s needs. For example, canvas pints can produce photography that can be displayed and framed as wall arts. Still photography, landscapes, portraits and even painting can be printed on a canvas.\r\n\r\nThe advertising and media industry also benefit from canvas printing. The concept of canvas printing is to combine creativity and technology together. It is used because of its artistic quality in making advertisement more appealing.\r\n\r\nGranted, with canvas printing, the fine artists employ creativity, such as metaphors and figurative speeches and symbols to convey the message. It can be powerful to invoke the minds and hearts of the one reading or viewing them.\r\n\r\nIf you are using an HP DesignJet printer, there are four types of canvass from which you can choose to print your images. These canvasses are Universal Matte, Artist Matte, Professional Matte, and Collector Satin.\r\n\r\nThe Universal Matte canvas is the least expensive of all and the thinnest as well. The quality of prints used with Universal Matte is fine, while the surface has a good texture. However, this canvass has the potential of showing small cracks when it is stretched on stretcher bars with sharper edge to them.\r\n\r\nThe Artist Matte canvas is more expensive than the Universal Matte. It is also heavier and brighter white than the Universal. The heavier weight makes the print quality even better. There are no cracking issues with it and the surface texture is nice.\r\n\r\nFor an excellent canvas, choose the Professional Matte. It is the brightest white compared to the other two. It is also much heavier.\r\n\r\nThe Collector Satin canvas is the most expensive and the heaviest. It is slightly less white and has satin for finish. The finishing print is glossy which reflects the light back to the one viewing the prints. Sometimes, the glossiness can get in the way of the print. Canvas prints are becoming more popular across the world.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to enter the world of Photos canvas? If so, then lets us help you get your photos on canvas.
